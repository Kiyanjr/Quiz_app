ðŸ§­ Quiz app:
Built as a personal finance tool and a practice project during my Flutter course.
it is a app that gives user 6 diffrent questions and user must click on the right answer
And in the end of game it gives the user the Answer it chose and the right one.

ðŸš©
I used diffrent widgets and wrote all the Costume widgets to have good looking app.
as EX: swtichScreen to tell the flutter when it should go to questions part or results part.
